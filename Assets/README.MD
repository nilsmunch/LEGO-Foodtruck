# LEGO Unity hiring case

A big part of working with kids experiences is to be able to see the fun and play in Digital experiences

This Unity project is bootstrapped with an internal LEGO tool (Model importer) that can be used to import various models as Unity GameObjects

Installation notes:
- Use Unity 2019.4.16f1 to open the test case project
- Upon importing the assets and receiving the prompt about enabling URP - click 'Yes'

---

(Menu "LEGO Tools"->"Import model")

In the /Assets/Studio Models folder we have provided some examples LEGO models in .io format

In the /Assets/Prefabs folder, a few of these models have been imported - as reference - to Unity GameObjects

Should you need more assets, feel free to download "Stud.io" from https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page and build your own (disclaimer, certain bricks might not import)


Now its time for you to Play - and demonstrate your creativity by building a fun, silly or maybe just awesome digital experience

A few ground rules to observe

- No AR/VR
- Use any private assets sound/music/models you want
- No redistribution of this Project to anyone outside LEGO either before/during or after creating it
- Project must be zipped and sent to LEGO before 3rd Interview
- Demo of this can be a short videoclip or by screensharing
- Have fun creating something :)


A few tips
- Stay small in scope
- We will look more at code than performance, so don't get bogged down on a bug, work around it or accept it
- Don't animate the minifigs - time is short
- It's okay to use free Asset Store assets
- Do not write any new shader from scratch and instead try to use Unity's built-in library of shaders
- Don't spend time on making fancy animated UI
- There is no decoration support in Studio so dont waste time getting them to display in Unity
- When finished, spend no more than 30 minutes analyzing memory allocations & GPU/CPU usage to see if everything is as expected
